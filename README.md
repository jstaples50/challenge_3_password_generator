# Challenge 3 Password Generator

## Description

This web application takes in a set of user parameters including:
- number of characters (min 8 max 128)
- whether to include lowercase characters
- whether to include uppercase characters
- whether to include special characters
- whether to include number characters

It then creates a randomly generated password based on the input from user.

Concepts that were worked on during this project:
- utilization of window prompts and user input
- construction of functions and calling methods
- loops (both definite and infinite), conditional statements, and manipulation of arrays 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Navigate to the webpage and follow prompts to generate random password.
Pull up DevTools console to see if the parameters for password were met.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
